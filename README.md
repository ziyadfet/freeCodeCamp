# freeCodeCamp
This repository contains the code I have written to obtain freeCodeCamp's certifications.
It includes the projects I found to be the most interesting:
- A page time views vizualizer that outputs a bar plot for vizualize the average monthly views, and a boxplot-pair that vizualizes the trend and the seasonality of the page views.
- A medical examination vizualizer that outputs a categorical plot of the total observations' medical variables (overweight,cardio status... etc) and a heatmap to detect the concentration of the data
- A sea level predictor that uses the Least Squared Linear Regression to predict the sea level to the year 2050 using the trends from the data from 1880-2013 (first line of best fit) and 2000-2013 (second line of best fit)
To complete these projects I have used the libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scipy.
